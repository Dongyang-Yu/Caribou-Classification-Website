	<h2>What is the PREDOMINANT vegetation?</h2>
	<h3><b>Poor visibility</b> - this video clip offers poor visibility of the predominant vegetation (ground and surroundings) near the caribou.</h3>
	<h3><b>Alpine tundra</b> - high elevation/latitude prevents tree growth. Vegetation grows close to the ground and consists mainly of grasses, sedges, forbs, and may include lichen, dwarf woody or semi - woody shrubs, or mosses.</h3>
	<h3><b>Lichen, moss, or herbaceous (grass, forbs/flowering plants)</b></h3>
	<h3><b>Shrubby</b> - small- to medium-sized woody plant, excluding coniferous saplings.</h3>
